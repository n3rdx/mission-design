Title: Technical Writing Guidelines Draft for ORI GitHub Mission-Design repo

THIS IS A DRAFT DOCUMENT - FOR DISCUSSION

This document is a test, and only a test. It may not survive.

I wanted to test if I can put in some relevant comments to define the technical writing standards for the mission documentation.

And that starts off with a question:

Do we put the standards in a TEXT file (this) or a some sort of formatted file (e.g., TeX, MS-Word, PDF) etc?
